    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li><strong>Toast the Bread:</strong></li>
        Toast the slices of sourdough bread to your preferred level of crispiness. A toaster or a heated skillet can be used for this step.

        <li><strong>Add Topping</strong>s:</li>
        Place the halved cherry tomatoes on top of the mashed avocado. Sprinkle the sesame seeds over the tomatoes, adding a nutty flavor and a bit of crunch.
        <li><strong>Final Touches:</strong></li>
        For an extra burst of flavor, drizzle a little olive oil over the top and add another pinch of salt and pepper if needed.
