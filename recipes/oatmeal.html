    <h3 >Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="list"><li>1 cup rolled oats</li>
        <li>2 cups water or milk (for creamier oatmeal, use milk)</li>
        <li>1 ripe banana, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup blueberries (fresh or frozen)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li></ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Oatmeal:</strong></li>
In a medium saucepan, bring the 2 cups of water or milk to a boil. Add a pinch of salt.
Stir in the rolled oats and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until the oats have absorbed the liquid and are creamy.
<li><strong>Add Flavors:</strong></li>
Once the oatmeal is nearly done, stir in the cinnamon and honey or maple syrup if using. This adds a lovely warmth and sweetness to the oatmeal.
<li><strong>Incorporate Fruits:</strong></li>
Remove the saucepan from heat. Gently fold in the sliced banana and blueberries, reserving some for topping. The residual heat will slightly soften the fruits without making them mushy.
<li><strong>Serve:</strong></li>
Spoon the oatmeal into a bowl. Top with the reserved slices of banana and a handful of blueberries for a fresh, colorful finish.
<li><strong>Garnish (Optional):</strong></li>
For an extra touch, sprinkle a little more cinnamon, a drizzle of honey, or a few chopped nuts over the top for added texture and flavor.
Enjoy your hearty and healthy oatmeal breakfast, perfect for starting your day with a burst of energy and sweetness!
